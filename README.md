# ispm

The IS Project Manager (or ispm, for short) is a utility, which aims to provide valuable help in managing a, possibly large, set of projects in the environment of the [webMethods Integration Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebMethods_Integration_Server).

The ispm grew out of a customer project, in which we had to develop, and maintain, hundreds of IS projects, so-called packages. By using a properly configured ispm, you will be able to clone an IS project from your hard drive, build, and install it into your local development IS within seconds.
